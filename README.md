# How to Run the App

By using this link https://we.tl/t-l1q3wjXxj3 you can simply download apk and can interact with the
result of this code.

# State Management

This project uses GetX for state management. Given the small scale of the project,
I chose GetX over BLoC for its simplicity and ease of use in lightweight applications.
While BLoC is powerful, it was not the most suitable choice for this particular use case.

# Infinite Pagination using ScrollController

Instead of using external pagination packages, infinite scrolling was implemented manually using
Flutter's native ScrollController.

# Project Structure

I have followed a clean and well-structured directory layout to keep the codebase organized and
maintainable.
This structure allows for scalability if the project grows in the future.

# Development Notes

I didn’t encounter major challenges during development. While there’s always room for improvement,
time constraints and other responsibilities
related to ongoing projects limited further refinements.
